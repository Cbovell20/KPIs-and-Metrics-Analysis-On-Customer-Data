# KPIs-and-Metrics-Analysis-On-Customer-Data

# Introduction
In this project, we will explore a customer database and use data analysis techniques to understand customer churn. We will use Python and SQL to extract and clean the data, and create visualizations.

# Dataset
We will use a sample customer database that includes customer demographic information (age, gender, location), purchase history, and whether or not the customer has churned. The dataset contains 10 customers with data that will be used to calculate churn rates and other metrics.

# Objectives
Our main objective in this project is to:

- Understand customer churn patterns
- Identify factors that influence churn rates
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer behavior

# Methodology
We will use the following methodology to achieve our objectives:
- Data Preparation: We will use Python and SQL to extract and clean the data, remove any duplicates, and transform the data into a format that is suitable for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- KPI Calculation: We will use the insights gained from the EDA to calculate KPIs related to customer behavior. These KPIs will help us identify trends, monitor performance, and make data-driven decisions.

# Deliverables
The deliverables for this project will include:

- Python code for data cleaning and transformation
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer behavior
- A project report summarizing the findings and insights gained from the analysis

# Conclusion
By the end of this project, we will have a deep understanding of customer churn patterns and the factors that influence churn rates. We will have identified key performance indicators that can be used to monitor customer behavior and make data-driven decisions that improve customer retention.
